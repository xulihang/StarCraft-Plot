- Destroy the enemy bases.||- Kill Duke.||- Kill Fenix.->- 摧毁敌人基地。||- 杀死杜克。||- 杀死费尼克斯。

Cerebrate, Duran, the time has come to separate the chaff from the wheat.  Now that the UED's power base is broken on this world, only their forces on Char pose any significant threat to me.  It's time to move to the second phase of my plan.->脑虫，杜兰。把石头从米饭中挑出去||的时候到了。眼下这个星球上的UED||基地已经被摧毁，他们只剩下在查尔||上的部队还能对我造成威胁。现在是||开始我的作战计划中第二阶段行动的||时候了。

And what of your allies here on Korhal, my Queen?  What would you have done with them?->那您在柯哈尔行星上的同盟呢，我的||女皇？您打算怎么处置他们？

They are of no further use to me.  Though they have proven themselves useful, it might be dangerous to allow them to live.  Without the services of General Duke, Mengsk will be easy to deal with.  But Raynor and Fenix are uncannily resourceful.  They must all be eradicated.  Cerebrate, I want both General Duke's and Fenix's bases destroyed.  Leave no one alive.->他们对我再没有用了。虽然他们证明||了自己的能力，但是让他们继续活下||去或许会非常危险。没有了杜克将军||，蒙斯克是小菜一碟。但雷纳和费尼||克斯两个人都非常机智，他们必须都||被消灭。脑虫，我要杜克将军和费尼||克斯的基地都被毁灭。不要留活口。

My Queen, if I may suggest a strategy?  Both the Protoss and Terran forces are resting after our previous victory.  If we attack immediately, while most of them are asleep and unaware, we can whittle down their defenses with relative ease!->我的皇后，我可以向您建议一个策略||吗？当前神族跟人族的部队都在我们||前次胜利后处于休息状态。如果我们||现在马上攻击他们，趁他们还在睡觉||放松警戒的功夫，我们可以相对容易||的摧毁他们的防御。

Clever.  How long after our initial attack can we expect them to regroup and retaliate?->聪明。从我们发动攻击到他们整编部||队反击之前我们有多少时间？

I'd say in 6 minutes.->我估计有６分钟。

That only gives us enough time to launch a surprise attack against one base.  But it is a sound plan.  Cerebrate, feel free to launch your initial attack against either base.  Failure is not an option.  Slaughter them all in my name!->那只能给我们对其中一个基地发动突||然袭击的时间。但仍然是一个可靠的||计划。脑虫，你可以随便对任一基地||发动攻击。只许成功不许失败。以我||的名义，杀光所有人！

How y'all doin?->你们好啊！

Kerrigan, you murdering bitch! We had a deal!->凯瑞甘，杀人越货的臭女人！我们是有协议的！

You're right, Fenix. I used you to get the job done, and||->你是对的，费尼克斯。我利用你来把活儿干完，||

you played along just like I knew you would. You Protoss||->而你也就像我所想的一样一直干了下来。你们||

are all so headstrong and predictable, you are your own||->神族都是头脑过于发达却易于猜测的，你是你||

I took that lesson to heart, Praetor. Now, are you ready ||->那堂课令我刻骨铭心，裁决官。现在，你做好||
