- Retrieve the Khalis crystal with a||  probe or drone.||            - OR -||- Do enough damage to the Overmind||  to send it into remission.->- 用探针或雄蜂取得柯哈里斯水晶。||            - 或者 -||- 打击主宰以令其进入休克状态。

Executor, the Uraj is secured and the UED has given up the chase. We are currently holding perimeter orbit over the planet Char. Zeratul, have you locked onto the location of the Khalis?->执行官，乌拉什水晶已在我们安全控||制之下，UED舰队也放弃了对我们的||追击。当前我们正围绕着查尔行星沿||轨道航行。泽拉托，您锁定到柯哈里||斯水晶所处位置了么？

Yes. I remember sensing its power the last time I was on this world. However, our sensors indicate a massive, fluctuating energy signature at its location. I am, however, unable to identify the signature's source.->是的。我记得前次我在这个星球上时||感应到了它的力量。但我们的感应器||显示在那位置上有一个庞大而无序的||能量信号。我无法识别该能量信号的||来源。

That should be obvious, gentlemen; the source is the Overmind itself. When the Cerebrates merged together, they must have locked onto the Khalis' energies and nested near it. It's probable that there'll be a number of Broods protecting that area. It's risky, but if we can strike hard and fast, we might be able to fight our way through their defenses and escape with the crystal.->显而易见，先生们；信号的来源正是||主宰。当脑虫们合并到一起的时候，||他们一定发现了柯哈里斯水晶的能量||然后在其上筑巢。这么一来很可能会||有数个虫群守卫那个区域。这样做比||较冒险，但倘若我们的攻击够快够狠||的话，也许我们能杀出一条血路带着||水晶逃出来。

Comrades, I may have an alternative. Seeing as how the Overmind is still in its infant stages, I wonder if we might be able to disrupt its control over those Broods. If we can do enough superficial damage to the creature, it might pacify the Zerg nearest to it, allowing us some time to retrieve the Khalis.->同伴们，我觉得还有另一个途径能获||得水晶。考虑到主宰尚在幼虫期，也||许我们能借此机会干扰它对虫群的控||制。如果我们对其造成足够大的表层||伤害，也许就能令临近它的虫族们平||静下来，从而让我们有时间取出柯哈||里斯水晶。

A bold plan, young Artanis. Your courage rivals that of mighty Tassadar himself!->一个大胆的妙计，年轻的阿尔坦尼斯||。你的勇气堪比无畏的塔萨达本人。

You give me too much credit, noble Zeratul. I am not worthy enough to even speak 'His' name.->您太夸奖我了，尊敬的泽拉托。我连||说“他”的名字都不配。

Touching. Look, boys, either of these plans will work, but let's not waste any time. I'll be able to exert limited control over a few of the Zerg here and provide you with some back-up. But the longer we stay, the more we risk losing both the crystals again.->好动人啊。听好了，伙计们，这两个||计划中的任何一个都可以奏效，但咱||们不要再浪费时间了。我可以有限的||控制这儿的部分虫族给你们做做后援||。但我们在这里耗得越久，我们离再||次失去两块水晶的时候越近。

Agreed. Executor, deploy your forces. May Adun be with you!->同意。执行官，部署你的部队。愿吾||神与你同在！

Executor, the Khalis is ours! Let us depart this wretched ||->执行官，柯哈里斯是我们的了！让我们离开这||
