Captain, the Dominion shipyards have been destroyed, and it seems that General Duke has withdrawn his forces from this quadrant. We have impressed most of the remaining Dylarian defense forces into the fleet and stand ready to move to the next phase of our invasion.->舰长，帝国船厂已被摧毁，杜克将军||也基本将他的部队撤离了本区域。我||们征召了绝大部分残余的迪拉利安防||御部队为UED舰队服务并且已做好下||阶段进攻的准备。

We've just received word from our research team that they've uncovered some kind of hidden weapons relay upon the planet Tarsonis. They report that it's called a Psi Disrupter, and that its purpose is somehow connected with the Zerg.->我们刚刚收到了研究部门的消息，他||们探测到了在行星塔尔苏尼斯上某种||武器系统发出的信号。报告称该武器||为幽能干扰器，它的功能和虫族似乎||有某种联系。

Admiral, during the Zerg invasion of these colonies, the Confederacy had manufactured a number of portable machines called Psi Emitters which had the uncanny ability to lure Zerg to their signals. It was rumored that they had created a specialized emitter that could disrupt the Zerg's communications, but Emperor Mengsk was never able to find it.||||It appears that this Psi Disrupter is the machine he was looking for. I must humbly suggest to you, Admiral, that the Disrupter be destroyed as quickly as possible. If it should fall into the hands of the Dominion we could face some very serious problems.->上将，在虫族入侵这些殖民地期间，||联盟制造了数台被称作“幽能发射器||”的可移动设备，这些机器具有神奇||的力量可以将虫族诱惑至信号所发出||的地方。传闻他们当时特制了一台可||以扰乱虫族间交流的发射器，但蒙斯||克从来没能找到它。似乎这台幽能扰||乱器正是他所寻找的仪器。我真诚的||建议您，将军，尽快的将这台仪器摧||毁。一旦它落在帝国手中我们将会面||临非常严重的问题。

Hmm. A prudent call, Lieutenant. I am inclined to agree. ->嗯。一个审慎的建议，少尉。我倾向||于同意你的意见。

But Admiral, this device could insure our victory over the Zerg! It is foolhardy to discard such an advantage!->但是上将，这个设备也可能会确保我||们在同虫族的作战中取得胜利！放弃||这么好的一个优势是相当不明智的！

Surely, Vice Admiral, you don't doubt the tenacity of your own fleet? Your Directorate forces will devastate the Zerg without the need for such a device. ->是啊是啊，中将阁下，你不会是怀疑||你自己的舰队的可靠性吧？你们的地||球部队用不着这台设备就可以将虫族||打个稀烂。

Listen here, Lieutenant, I've had just about enough of your-->听好，少尉。我快受够了你的…

This conversation is over, Alexei. Given the true nature of our mission to enslave the Overmind, we could hardly stand to have Mengsk control a device of this magnitude. This Psi Disrupter must be destroyed in order to safeguard our mission. Ensign, set your course for Tarsonis.->谈话到此结束，阿列克斯。鉴于我们||最初的使命本就是征服主宰，我们决||不能让蒙斯克有任何机会获得这台如||此重要的仪器。幽能干扰器必须被摧||毁以确保我们的使命能够安全完成。||少尉，你可以向塔尔苏尼斯动身了。
