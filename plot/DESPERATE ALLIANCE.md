I got your message, Magistrate, and frankly I don't care what you have to say about Confederate regulations. You damn fringe world yokels are all alike, don't know where your loyalties lie. Y'all have a real good day now, y'hear?->我收到了你信息，总督。说实话，||你其实不用在乎什么联盟规则。你||们这些偏远地区的乡巴老都一样，||不知道应该向谁效忠。今天过得还||不错，是吧？

Transmission ended. The report you requested is ready. Sixteen outland stations have reported sightings of the alien invaders identified as Zerg. The Confederates have arrested all standing militia forces and continue to avoid action against the Zerg. Three stations have fallen to the Zerg already. We've been unable to locate any source of military relief except... the extremist faction known as The Sons of Korhal. Their liaison is holding on line.->讯息传送结束。您要的报告已经准||备好了：十六个边防站报告发现了||虫族的入侵。联盟停止了反抗来避||免跟虫族发生正面冲突。三个边防||站已被攻陷。除了柯哈尔之子的激||进主义组织，我们得不到军事支援||。我正在尝试与他们联系。

Good day, Magistrate. My name is Arcturus Mengsk, and I represent The Sons of Korhal. You're familiar with the Confederate propaganda surrounding my group, but your reputation suggests you'll see past it. It's never been our practice to operate in any one place for long, but these Zerg don't look like they're going to wait. I'm going to make you an offer, Magistrate. I'd like to help you out by sending down a number of transports to your colony and evacuating any survivors.->你好，总督。我是阿克特鲁斯．||蒙斯克，我代表着柯哈尔之子。你||大概对我和我的组织早有耳闻吧，||联盟政府一向善于编造各式各样的||谎言。但是，你那里的事态似乎使||你不得不把有关我的一些坏话从你||聪明的脑袋里过滤掉。我们向来不||在一个地方停留太久，而你附近的||那些虫族看来似乎已经等不及了啊。

You know, of course, that my organization operates outside the bounds of Confederate law. That's why they spread their lies and misinformation. If you decide to accept our help, you'll be branded as an outlaw too. But, it's a chance to save those people. Time to make a stand, Magistrate.->你知道，我和我的组织在外面从来||不遵守联盟的法律。这也是他们散||布关于我们的坏话的原因。如果||你决定接受我们的帮助，你也将成||一个违法的人。但是，这是救那些||可怜的人民的唯一的机会。该作决||定了，亲爱的总督。
