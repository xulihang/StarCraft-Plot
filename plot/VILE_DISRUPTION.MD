Greetings, Cerebrate. By now you've realized that I've severed your connection with the Overmind and your renegade brethren. Understand, it's nothing personal. I just can't risk you falling under their influence. You're mine now. Serve me unquestioningly, and I'll let you live.->你好，脑虫。到现在你该认识到我已||经切断了你和主宰及其他你的兄弟之||间的联系。要明白，这只是公事公办||。我不能冒将你落到他们势力之下的||风险。现在你属于我了。对我唯命是||从，我会让你活下去的。

My Queen, pardon me for interrupting, but the visitors you have been expecting have arrived.->我的女皇，请原谅我打断您的谈话，||但是您所期望的访客们到了。

Finally. They certainly took their time.->终于来了。他们可是耗了不少时间。

Yeah, well none of us were in any real hurry to get here, Sarah.->是啊，要知道我们没一个人着急来这||儿，萨拉。

Still suspicious of my motives, Jimmy?->还在怀疑我的动机，吉米？

Always.->从来都是。

Heh. When I contacted you both on Aiur, I told you about the new Overmind and about the UED that seeks to control it. Well, the UED has done it. They've tamed the Overmind and now control most of the Zerg broods in this sector. That's why I've asked for your help.->哼。当我和艾尔上的你们二人联系时||，我已告诉过你们关于新的主宰以及||试图控制它的UED的事情。现在UED已||经成功了。他们驯化了主宰并且控制||了绝大部分的虫族群落。这就是我要||你们帮忙的原因。

You want us to help you defeat the UED so that you alone will rule the Zerg!->你想让我们帮你打败UED所以你可以||独自统治虫族！

Wrong, Fenix. I want to defeat them because if we don't, they'll clamp down on this sector, and enslave us all! You know I'm right Jim. You've studied the history of Earth, you know what the UED's agenda is. Taking control of the Zerg is only the beginning for them.->错，费尼克斯。我想击败他们是因为||如果我们不这么做，他们会一点一点||完全占据这个区域，然后奴役我们所||有人！你知道我是对的，吉姆。你学||过关于地球的历史，你知道UED的计||划是什么。控制虫族只不过是他们的||开始。

Maybe... I don't know...->也许吧…我不知道…

My Queen, again I beg your pardon for this interruption, but we have a very serious problem!->我的女皇，很抱歉我再一次打断您的||谈话。但我们有个很严重的问题！

Perfect timing... Gentlemen, we'll need to finish this conversation later... continue, Duran.->来得早不如来的巧…先生们，我们得||稍后再完成这次对话…继续，杜兰。||

The Psi Disrupter's signal has reached us here on Tarsonis and shattered the unity of your broods! Within the past few hours, your minions have turned on each other and left their hive clusters to run out of control!->幽能干扰器的信号已经传到了我们塔||尔苏尼斯上并且破坏了你的虫群之间||的团结。在过去的数小时内，您的属||下们开始互相攻击并且对他们的蜂房||放任不管！

This is just what I need. Cerebrate, take the few Zerg still under my control and do what you can to stem any further damage to the hive clusters. I can't afford to have them destroyed by my own minions!->这正是我所要的。脑虫，带上那些仍||然在我控制下的虫族，尽一切力量避||免蜂房群落再受任何损害。我可经不||起让他们被我自己的亲信摧毁的代价||。

My Queen, the hive structures are not responding to the||->我的女皇，蜂房组织对脑虫的命令没有反应。||

Cerebrate's commands! There is no way to reinforce your||->我们无法增援您的勇士们。
