||"THE QUEST FOR URAJ"||||Protoss fleet orbiting the planet Braxis||->||“寻找乌拉什”||||位于布拉克西斯行星的神族舰队||

- Bring Kerrigan to the Uraj crystal.||- Kerrigan must survive.->- 将凯瑞甘带到乌拉什水晶处。||- 凯瑞甘必须存活。

Now then, Kerrigan. Perhaps you had best explain yourself. What is this news you've come to give?->那么现在，凯瑞甘，你最好解释一下||。你给我们带来了什么消息？

There is a new Overmind growing on Char.->在查尔星上有一个新的主宰正在成长||。

What? Impossible! Why should we believe anything you have to say?->什么？不可能！我们凭什么相信你？ 

Because, Zeratul, I'm no longer the mindless murderess whom you fought on Char. The Overmind is dead. Whatever warped control it once had over me is gone. I know that this is a lot to take in all at once, but you've got to believe me! There's more at stake here than-->那是因为，泽拉格，我不再是那个你||们在查尔星对抗过的没有主见的女杀||手了。主宰已经死了，它曾施加在我||身上的各种各样的控制也就此结束了||。我知道这很难一次跟你说明白，但||是你必须相信我！在这个紧要的关头||有其他更多需要我们关心的…

She lies! She is infested to the core! I for one will not listen to any of this-->她撒谎！她已经烂到了骨头里！我不||要再听任何…

Silence, Judicator. Continue, Kerrigan.->安静，执法官。继续，凯瑞甘。

Apparently, many of the renegade Cerebrates, commanded by Daggoth, have merged into a new Overmind. Fortunately, the creature is still in its infant stages. It can't control the Swarm yet, but Daggoth and the others still have control over most of the Broods. The two Cerebrates you killed here were part of Daggoth's forces.||||Look, I don't need to tell you all what might happen if that thing reaches maturity. I can guarantee you that should it awaken, it'll take full control of me just like it did before. I don't want that to happen, and I'm pretty sure you don't want it to happen either.->据信有很多变节脑虫听命于达格斯合||并成了一个新的主宰。幸运的是它目||前还处于幼虫期。幼小的主宰虽然尚||不能控制整个虫群，但达格斯及其他||脑虫仍然掌握着绝大多数的虫族族群||。你们不久前杀死的那两只脑虫正是||达格斯属下的一支部队。我想我不用||再多此一举告诉你们等新主宰发育成||熟会有什么样的后果。但我可以担保||它一旦觉醒，它就会像从前一样完全||的控制我。我可不想让往事重演，想||必你们也一定不希望如此吧。

Even if what you say is true, our priority is to save this world, not assault the new Overmind! We must find the crystals Uraj and Khalis before we are all vanquished.->即便你说的是真的，我们当务之急也||是要先保住这个行星，而不是冒然对||新主宰发动进攻！我们必须在大家都||被毁灭之前找到乌拉什和柯哈里斯两||块水晶。

Then I'll help you with your search. If you can defeat the renegade Zerg gathered here, it'll weaken the efforts of Daggoth and his ilk.->既然如此我会帮你们一起寻找水晶。||如果你们能击败这里的虫族，那将削||弱达格斯和他的嫡系们的势力。

My children, you must put aside your fears and misgivings to accomplish what must be done. For the time being, Kerrigan will assist you in your endeavors. Though she has been your enemy, it is enough that we share the same agenda now. Allow her time enough to prove herself to you, and you may find her to be a valued ally. For now, you must focus on the task at hand. Search for the Uraj on the planet Braxis, and let nothing stop you from recovering it.->我的孩子们，你们必须放下心中的恐||惧和疑虑去完成必须完成的任务。就||目前来说，凯瑞甘将会协助你们一同||前行。虽然她曾经是你们的敌人，但||我们现在在为共同的目标而奋斗。给||她足够的时间去证明她自己，你们也||许会发现她是个有价值的同盟。眼下||你必须专注于手头的任务。搜寻在布||拉克西斯行星上的乌拉什水晶，不要||让任何其他事情阻挡你们！

We will do what you ask, Matriarch. But you cannot expect us to forgive Kerrigan's crimes against our race! Executor, prepare our forces. We shall debark for the planet Braxis before the next moonrise.->我们会遵从您的命令，酋长女士。但||是你不能指望我们宽恕凯瑞甘对我们||族人所犯下的罪行。执行官，准备好||我们的部队，我们将在月亮升起之前||登陆布拉克西斯。

Explain something to me,  Zeratul. Why would your people leave||->给我讲讲，泽拉托，你们怎么能让如此珍贵的||

such a sacred crystal in the hands of these Terrans?->水晶落在这些人类手上？

We didn't. Long ago, this world was a Protoss colony called||->许久以前，这个星球曾经是个被叫做克拉多尔||

Khyrador. When the strife between our tribes escalated, this||->的神族聚居地。后来随着部落间的冲突不断升||

planet and the Uraj Crystal were abandoned. These Terrans||->级，这个星球以及乌拉什水晶便被一同遗弃了。||

have come here only recently.->这些人族只是最近才来到这里的。

Executor, we have a problem. Our warp matrix was damaged||->执行官，出问题了。我们的传送主机在运送过||

during transit. Because of the extensive damage, we will be||->程中被损坏了。由于多处受损，我们将无法把||

unable to warp-in stargates to this location!->              星际之门传送到这个地点。

The Crystal's here, boys!  Send in a probe to gather||->水晶在这里，伙计们！派个探针过来把它收集||

it up and our work here is done.->起来后我们的任务就完成了。

You have done well, Kerrigan.  There is more ||->你做的很好，凯瑞甘。你比从表面上看似乎更||

to you than it seems.  Perhaps I have misjudged you.->有内涵。也许我当初错看你了。

Given our history, I can't say I blame ya'.  Let's||->鉴于我们的过去，我也不能怪你什么。我们把||

just get the job done.->活儿干完就是了。
