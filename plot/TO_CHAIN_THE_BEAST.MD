Captain, with the Psi Disrupter's signal hampering the Zergs' communications to one another, the Swarms over Char have scattered in disarray, allowing the fleet to penetrate to the planet's surface. However, there is still a considerable number of defenders nestled around the fledgling Overmind.->指挥官，有了幽能干扰器阻碍虫族之||间的联络，艾尔上的各虫群已经溃散||的七零八落了，借此舰队可穿行至行||星的地表。不过，在主宰幼虫的周围||仍有数量可观的防御力量存在。

Alexei was right. The Disrupter is the key to victory here. If I had destroyed the machine as Duran suggested we would never have made it this far... Nevertheless, the time is upon us, Captain, to do what we came here for. We will claim the Overmind in the name of Humanity!->阿列克斯是对的。幽能干扰器是我们||胜利的关键所在。如果我听杜兰的销||毁了它，我们将永远走不到今天这一||步…无论如何，指挥官，完成我们来||这里所要做的使命的时候到了。我们||将以全人类的名义捕获主宰！

Be advised, Captain: our sensors have identified three cerebrates who constitute the core of the Overmind's defenses. Each cerebrate's distinct capabilities are still unknown, so proceed with extreme caution.->指挥官，请注意：我们的感应器侦测||到了由三个脑虫所构成主宰的防御核||心。各脑虫的特殊能力尚无法确定，||所以前进中请多加小心。

Launch your forces and let not a Zerg survive! Once you have reached the Overmind and crushed its defenders, you are to send in specially trained medics who will pacify the creature with potent Neurostim drugs. Only then will our victory be assured.||||And Captain, remember that Duran is still out there somewhere. I'd venture a guess that his treachery has only just begun. Be careful and good luck. I am sure that this will be our finest hour.->发动你的进攻，一只小虫子都不要给||我留下！当你到达主宰并瓦解掉它的||防御时，你要派遣数个受过特殊训练||的医护兵使用强力神经药剂来控制主||宰。只有到那时我们才能确保胜利。||还有指挥官，请记住杜兰仍躲在某地||，我料想他的整个背叛行动才刚开始||。小心谨慎，祝你好运。我相信这将||是我们最辉煌的时刻。
