- Destroy the Zerg cerebrates.->- 摧毁虫族脑虫。

I am Raszagal, Matriarch of the Dark Templar, and I welcome you and your companions to our world. Zeratul has informed me of the fall of Aiur, and I am deeply grieved. I am one of the few Dark Templar old enough to remember our ancestral home with clarity. Yet, no matter how tragic the circumstances, it is clear that fortune has reunited our people. ||||We Dark Templar will never forget our banishment from Aiur, nor the Conclave's sins against us. But you and your companions are no longer of the Conclave. The example set by your fallen hero, Tassadar, has shown you that when the light and dark sides of our energies are united, our power is undeniable.->我是拉施嘉尔，黑暗圣堂武士的女酋||长，欢迎你和你的伙伴们来到我们的||世界。泽拉托已经向我报告了艾尔的||陷落，为此我感到无比难过。我是为||数不多的几个还能清楚记得原乡模样||的黑暗圣堂武士之一。然而无论眼下||情形有多么悲惨，命运终又让我们大||家团结到了一起。我们黑暗圣堂武士||永远不会忘记被艾尔驱逐的过程和最||高议会对我们所犯下的罪过。但你和||你的朋友们不在此列。你们逝去的英||雄塔萨达所留下的事迹，已向你们展||示了当光明和黑暗的能量联合在一起||时，我们的力量是无可比拟的。

But Matriarch, the Zerg who have followed us here are unlike any enemy the Protoss have ever known!->可是酋长女士，那些追踪我们来到这||里的虫族和以往神族所遇到过的任何||敌人都不一样！

You speak the truth, Judicator. And yet, there lies a dormant power here that can help us to scour the Zerg from Shakuras forever. Long ago, we Dark Templar were a nomadic people. But when we found a remarkable monument upon this world, we decided to remain here to study it. We discovered that the enormous structure is actually an ancient Xel'Naga Temple, dedicated to the race that sired us all. The Temple is situated above a nexus of powerful cosmic energies. If we were to access those energies...->你说的是事实，执法官。但幸运的是||，此地有一个尚在沉睡中的力量能助||我们将虫族从沙古拉斯上永远赶出去||。许久以前，我们黑暗圣堂武士曾是||一个四处漂泊的民族。但当我们在这||个星球上发现了一个不寻常的石碑后||，我们便决定就此留下来研究它。后||来我们发现那座巨大的建筑物实际上||是一座赛尔纳加圣殿，一座用来缅怀||那曾经抚养了我们所有人的先人的圣||殿。圣殿被置于一座拥有强大宇宙能||量的神族基地的底基之上。如果我们||能获得那里的能量…

Then we should strike now while the Zerg still muster their forces!->既然如此，我们应该趁虫族部队还在||集结时立刻用神庙的能量展开攻击！||

Alas, we cannot. In order to properly channel the energies of the Temple, we will need the twin crystals, Uraj and Khalis, that legends say were separated many ages ago. The Uraj is laced with pure Templar energies, while the Khalis is comprised of Dark Templar energy. Only by using these two crystals in unison, can we hope to channel the potent energies of the Temple.->唉，我们做不到。我们需要双水晶才||能正确的引导神庙中的能量，据传说||乌拉什和柯哈里斯双水晶在多年前就||失散了。乌拉什水晶被赋予了纯圣殿||武士的能量，而柯哈里斯水晶相应则||是由纯黑暗圣堂武士的能量构成的。||只有和谐的使用这两块水晶，我们才||能激发出神庙中强大的力量。

Then it is clear that we must retrieve these crystals wherever they may be.->那么显然无论这两块水晶在哪里，我||们都必须重新把它们找回来。

Agreed. But first, we must deal with the Zerg and their two Cerebrates who have already taken up station around the Temple itself. To arms, my children! Scour the Temple grounds of this foul infestation!->同意。但首先我们得先解决掉这里两||只占据了神庙的脑虫。我的孩子们，||准备好你们手中的武器！把这些渣滓||从神庙里清除出去！

Remember, young Templar, cerebrates can be killed only by Dark||->请记住，年轻的圣堂武士，脑虫只能被黑暗圣||

Templar weapons and energies.  My brethren will make short work||->堂武士的能量和武器消灭。我的弟兄们是不会||

of any cerebrate!->在脑虫身上浪费任何功夫的！

Executor, our sensors show that the two Cerebrates are surrounded||->执行官，感应器显示两只脑虫周围有许多防空||

by spore colonies.  We will deploy our Corsairs to compensate for ||->塔守护。我们会派遣海盗船来削弱它们的防守。

their defenses.->

Well done, mighty Protoss! I'm glad to see that you all are as ||->干的不赖啊，老神族！看到你们的火气还是这||

violent as ever.->么大我可真高兴。

              Kerrigan! What mockery is this?->              凯瑞甘！你怎敢如此出言不逊？

Relax, warriors. Despite what you may think, I haven't come here||->放松些，勇士们。不管你们是怎么想的，我反||

to fight you.->正不是来和你们打架的。

This is laughable! Do you truly expect us to believe that your ||->可笑！你真的以为我们会相信你来这里的动机||

intentions here are honorable? That these Zerg here are not ||->是高尚的？难道这些虫族不是被你所左右的么？

under your sway?->

Look, the Cerebrates you've killed were my enemies as well. If you||->听着，你们刚刚杀死的脑虫也是我的敌人。如||

let me explain, I'm sure you'll understand tha-->果容我解释的话，我相信你们能明白—

You are the enemy of all who live, Kerrigan.  What makes you think||->你才是这世界上所有生命共同的敌人，凯瑞甘。||

we would have anything to do with you?->你凭什么认为我们会和你打交道？

Because, Zeratul, I bring news of an event that threatens us all. If||->那是因为，泽拉托，我带来的是一件威胁到我||

you'd be so good as to escort me back to your Citadel, I'll tell you||->们所有人的消息。如果你能好心把我带回你们||

everything I know.->的大本营，我会把一切我所知道的告诉你。

Very well, Kerrigan. We shall hear what you have to say. But be||->好吧，凯瑞甘。我们来听听你有什么可说的。||

warned: We will not suffer your treachery here.->但警告你，这里不是你能随便背信弃义的地方。
