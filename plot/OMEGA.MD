Cerebrate, our scouts have just identified three separate fleets approaching this platform. With Duran having disappeared, and the bulk of my broods still on the surface of Char, you'll need to hold off the invaders by yourself.->脑虫，我们的侦察部队刚才侦测到三||支舰队正在向这里接近。杜兰不见了||，并且我们绝大部分的部队都还位于||查尔行星的表面上，你必须靠你自己||抵挡这些入侵者了。

It is long past time you paid for your crimes against our people.->凯瑞甘，我是阿尔坦尼斯。我和我的||兄弟们来此为费尼克斯，女酋长以及||其他所有被虫群所杀的神族复仇！过||去的日子太长了，是该让你偿还你对||我们族人所犯下的罪行的时候了。

||EPILOGUE||||Shortly after DuGalle's defeat, the remainder of the UED Fleet was overtaken by Kerrigan's forces and eradicated.

||And alone, floating on a dark platform above the burnt-out planet of Char, Sarah Kerrigan, the Queen of Blades, sat and lorded over the ravenous Swarms. Unable to shake the feeling that a great threat loomed just over the horizon, Kerrigan could only stare off into the vastness of space where she beheld a great void. Or perhaps a reflection of a hollow victory and of the trials yet to come...||->||只有她，在焚毁的查尔行星外一个黑暗的空间平台上，萨拉・凯瑞甘，刀||锋女皇，看着地面如狼似虎的虫群而作威作福。她总感觉到一个巨大的威||胁正从地平线上渐渐显现却无法解释，凯瑞甘只能注视着广阔的星空感觉||到无限的空虚。那也许就代表着空洞的胜利和即将来临的考验……
