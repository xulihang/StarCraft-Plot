Captain, once again your leadership has set a fine example to the rest of my officers. Vice Admiral Stukov has informed me that the Psi Disrupter has been accounted for, so we can now proceed with the next phase of our operation. The time has come to begin our primary invasion of the Dominion Throne-world of Korhal. Alexei, fill the Captain in on the current situation.->指挥官，你的领导才能再一次为其他||的军官们树立了良好的榜样。斯图可||夫中将向我汇报幽能干扰器已经被适||当处理，那么我们可以实施下一步作||战计划了。正式开始我们对帝国主星||柯哈尔的主攻的时机已到。阿列克斯||，向指挥官汇报一下当前的情况。

As you may know from your research, Captain, Korhal was a hotbed of anti-Confederate sentiment for years. The Confederacy hoped to contain Korhal's civil unrest by decimating it and its population with a massive nuclear barrage. Though the radiation levels on the planet are at an all time low, its surface is now nothing more than a smoldering desert.->如同您在调查中所了解的情况一样，||指挥官，柯哈尔曾经是多年反联盟运||动的温床。人族联盟为了镇压当地的||动荡局面，使用了大量核武器密集攻||击以彻底消除暴乱和当地人口。尽管||该星球上的辐射量目前处在历史最低||点，但地表仍只剩下一片焦干的沙漠||而已。

The catch, Admiral, is that because this world has already been devastated by nuclear fire, Mengsk has no compunction against using Nukes on us. We have detected a large cluster of missile silos on the outskirts of Augustgrad. If those silos were destroyed, we believe that Mengsk would lose his core nuclear capabilities.->关键在于，将军，这个星球已经基本||上被核爆炸给烧毁了，蒙斯克也不会||为在这里对我们使用核武器有任何后||顾之忧。我们侦查到在奥古斯特格勒||的周边有大量导弹发射井。如果这些||发射井能被摧毁，我们相信蒙斯克将||失去他进行核打击的核心战斗力。

We also face a different obstacle, Captain. Intelligence has informed us that Mengsk employs multiple battlecruisers for his planetary defense. It is possible to nullify these battlecruisers by taking out strategic physics labs. Without these labs, Mengsk will be unable to power-up his ships' weapons systems.->我们同时还面对着另一个障碍，指挥||官。情报部门汇报说蒙斯克在他的行||星防御系统中部署了多艘巡洋战舰。||我们可以通过干掉他的物理研究所来||令这些巡洋战舰失效。没有了这些研||究所，蒙斯克将无法启动他的战舰上||的武器系统。

Though we know how to compensate for Mengsk's defenses, we don't have enough time to follow through on them both. Therefore, Captain, you must choose to either counter his nuclear capabilities or his battlecruisers. Once you've taken care of this operation, we can begin to plan our final assault against Augustgrad.->虽然我们知道该如何对付蒙斯克的防||御，我们却没有足够的时间把这两个||步骤逐一完成。因此，指挥官，你只||能选择摧毁他的核能力或者巡洋战舰||中的一样。一旦你完成了这次行动，||我们就可以发动对奥古斯特格勒的最||后总攻了。

Well done, Captain. We won't need to worry about ||->干得好，指挥官。当我们包围蒙斯克的皇宫时||

nukes when we siege Mengsk's palace.->候不再需要担心核导弹了。

Superbly done, Captain. Mengsk's battlecruisers are ||->干的非常好，指挥官。蒙斯克的巡洋战舰已经||

now effectively powerless. He won't be able to use ||->失效了。当我们进攻他的宫殿时他将不再能使||

them against us when we assault his palace.->用它们来对付我们了。
