Greetings Executor! And greetings to you, Tassadar. I am overjoyed to see you both return home in this dark hour. The Zerg have redoubled their efforts, and it seems-->致敬，执行官！也向你致敬，塔萨||达。在这一非常时刻能看见你们回||来，我非常高兴。虫族加强了它们||的攻势，而且似乎…… 

Fenix? It can't be! The Executor told me of how you fell before the Zerg. How is it that you live and breathe?->费尼克斯？这不可能！执行官告诉||我，你已被虫族所杀。你怎能活生||生的出现在我面前？
