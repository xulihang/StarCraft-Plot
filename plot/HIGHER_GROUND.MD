Executor, I bring news most dire. The Cerebrate that we thought we had killed has arisen again. The creature's battered form was reincarnated, despite the considerable damage we inflicted upon it. Even now, the Cerebrate drives its Brood in preparation for their next offensive.->执行官，我带来了很可怕的消息。||我们以为已经被杀死的脑虫又复活||了。虽然我们对它造成了严重的伤||害，但它的残破形体得到了重生。||现在，这个脑虫正率领它的家族，||准备发动新一轮进攻。

It is as I feared. It was folly to believe Tassadar could be trusted. The Conclave will not soon forget his wanton betrayal. Nevertheless, we must stand resolute. For attacking defenseless Cerebrates is not the way of true Protoss warriors! We shall overcome the entire Swarm with the might and the fury that is our heritage!->正如我所预料的。对塔萨达存有信||任是愚蠢的。最高议会不会忘记他||的无耻的背叛。不过，我们必需坚||定立场。进攻毫无防御能力的脑虫||并不是真正神族战士的做风！我们||将光明磊落地以自己的力量和勇气||去战胜虫群！

Executor, we shall lead our main strike force to the province of Scion which has fallen to the Zerg. It's time the Zerg felt the wrath of the Sons of Aiur! Praetor Fenix will remain here with a small detachment and guard Antioch from any further assaults.->执行官，我们率领主要攻击部队到||虫族曾经被击溃的斯昂地区，是到||了愤怒的艾尔之子把虫族碾碎的时||候了。裁判官费尼克斯和少量的分||遣队留守这里以防备安提亚克受到||任何偷袭。

||The Zerg Hive cluster near the Scion province was destroyed, but the Protoss forces paid a high price for their victory.||||Praetor Fenix, hero and Steward of the Templar, was killed during the assault. The Conclave, convinced that its stratagems are winning the war against the Zerg, have let down their guard and turned their attention to personal matters. The Judicator Aldaris was ordered to find and arrest the wayward Tassadar and bring him home to stand trial for his crimes of treason.||||Now, with only a small fleet for protection, Aldaris and the Executor have traveled to the ash world of Char, hoping that Tassadar is still somewhere to be found.||->||斯昂地区附近的虫族蜂房簇被消灭了，可是神族部队为这一胜利付出了沉||重的代价，圣堂武士的英雄费尼克斯在虫族的偷袭中牺牲。||||最高议会认为用他们的战略能够击败虫族，因而松懈了警戒，开始解决其||内部问题。执政官阿尔达瑞斯受命寻找并逮捕不听号令的塔萨达，然后带||回艾尔以叛国罪加以审判。现在，在仅有小批舰队的护送下，阿尔达瑞斯||和执行官来到了灰暗的查尔行星，希望在那里还能找到塔萨达。
