- Destroy the Overmind.||- Tassadar, Raynor, and ||  Zeratul must survive.->- 摧毁主宰.||- 塔萨达, 雷纳, 泽拉托不能死亡.

Executor, our plan worked perfectly. The Zerg defenses are broken, and the way to the Overmind is laid bare! The time for our stand has come.->执行官，我们的计划非常成功。虫||族的防御已被破坏，通往主宰的道||路已经肃清！反戈一击的时候到了||。

As do I.->不错。

Well, I guess all I have left is to see this through. The Zerg have taken everything from me: my home, my family, my friends. I know that nothing I do can bring those things back, but I'll be damned if I just sit on my hands and wait for the end. I want a piece of 'em, all right. I'm in.->嘿，我想我留下是能看完一切的。||虫族夺取了我的一切：我的家园、||我的家庭、我的朋友。我知道那一||切再也无法挽回，但我厌恶坐等一||切结束。我要尽一份力，好了。我||的机会来了。

||EPILOGUE||||As the chaotic, swirling energies subsided, a heavy silence settled over the battlefields of Aiur. Due to Tassadar's noble sacrifice, the Overmind was now dead and the Zerg Swarms were scattered and broken. But as the heroes surveyed their once glorious homeland, they realized that their victory had cost them all but their lives. Aiur was left nothing more than a smoldering ruin. Those few Protoss who survived the final battle could only wonder what the future would hold for their race.||->||尾声||||当剧烈震荡的三方能量平息下去后，艾尔的战场上笼罩着一片沉寂。由于||塔萨达英勇地牺牲了自己，主宰终于死去了，虫族种群也四处逃散，残缺||不全。可是当英雄们巡视他们一度繁荣的家园时，却发现他们已为这一胜||利付出了一切，除了他们的生命……||||在行星艾尔上，只剩下了冒着硝烟的一片废墟。这场决战中幸存下来的神||族战士寥寥无几，他们不由思忖，种族的未来究竟会是怎样？

||And far away, on the distant planet Char, Kerrigan, the self-styled Queen of Blades, knew that the time of her ascension was||at hand.||->||而在遥远的查尔行星，自行其事的刀锋女皇－－凯瑞甘也明白，她一步登||天的机会来临了。||

||PROTOSS CAMPAIGN: THE STAND||||The nefarious Zerg Overmind has been destroyed and the Protoss homeworld of Aiur now lies in smoking ruin. As the Executor of the remaining Protoss forces, you must now attempt to reunite your beleaguered people and save them from the ravenous Zerg who still roam mindlessly across the blackened fields of Aiur.||->||神族战役：抵抗||||穷凶极恶的虫族主宰已经被消灭掉了，神族的家园艾尔也只剩下一片片硝||烟未尽的废墟。残存下来的虫族肆无忌惮地在艾尔的旷野中游猎。作为神||族部队执行官，你必须把幸存的神族力量团结起来，救出被虫群围困的神||族人民。
