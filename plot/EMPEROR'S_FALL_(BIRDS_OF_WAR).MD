Ah, Captain, we've been expecting you. As you may have guessed, we are coordinating our final attack plans.

And, Captain, remember that although we disabled Mengsk's nuclear capabilities, he still commands a large number of Battlecruisers. We suspect that he will use these ships against us at every turn. Be on your guard, Captain. Show this 'Emperor' what the UED thinks of his rule.->还有，指挥官，记住虽然我们解除了||蒙斯克的核打击能力，他仍然统帅着||大批巡洋战舰。我们估计他将会不停||的对我们使用那些战舰。提高警惕，||指挥官。让这个“皇帝”明白UED究||竟是如何看待他的统治的。
